require 'middleman-gh-pages'

#
# Configuration Parameters 
#
# @deploy_cmd set command to deploy your website
#
# use the special symbol __build_dir__ to indicate the build directory.
# At runtime, __build_dir__ will be replaced by the appropriate build
# dir.
#
# If you need to deploy to different environments with different
# commands, you can create a file _env-<environment name>.rb (e.g.,
# _env-production.rb), where you can customize the variables for the
# specific environment.
#
# Example
#
#     rsync -avz __build_dir__ user@example.com:/dest/dir/
#

@deploy_cmd = "rake publish BRAND_NAME=public PROJECT_ROOT=build"

# git_check    if true, block deployment if the monitored remote branch is ahead of
#              the current branch.  Publishing an out-of-date
#              repository, in fact, could cause a regression on the content of the
#              website
#
# git_autopush if true, after deployment, add, commit, and change any local
#              change to the remote repository
#
# git_branch   the remote branch to monitor.  It defaults to master; gh-pages is the
#              value you want for GitHub pages.
#

#@git_check ||= true
#@git_autopush ||= false
#@git_branch ||= "master"
